Mental health is increasingly recognized as both a negative health outcome and as a contributor to other negative health outcomes. Correspondingly, implementation studies may address mental health in different ways, ranging from screening to incorporating mental health into other programs to directly targeting mental health as a primary outcome. Importantly, a critical cross-cutting theme is engagement with the community at all stages of implementation. In this symposium, we will highlight different ways in which implementation science is addressing mental health in community-based settings, with focus on the role of community partnering and engagement at varying stages of implementation.\nChair: Christine L Gray, Assistant Research Professor, Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research\nDiscussant: Susan Reif, Research Scholar, Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nPresenter\n\n\n\n\nCommunity informed adaptation and implementation of a mental health and substance use screening and referral process in HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) care in the US Deep South\nSusan Reif\n\n\nImplementing positive youth development and sexuality education to address health disparities in rural North Carolina\nGenevieve (GV) Hunter\n\n\nMental Health of Indigenous Gay and Bisexual Men in Guatemala: a qualitative study\nLucia Weyer Johnson\n\n\nEnhancing Peer Support in Medical Spaces for Substance Dependency and Harm Reduction Among LGBTQIA+ Individuals in the South\nJemm Merritt"
