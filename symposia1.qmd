## Features and challenges in the design and analysis of trials in global mental health research

When evaluating interventions and programs in mental health research, a vast range of different trial designs are available. The final choice of design is based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to the nature of the intervention being evaluated, the research context, the primary research question and logistical and other related considerations. In this symposium, we will use ongoing and completed mental health studies to highlight features and challenges in several trial designs, including preference trials, individually-randomized group treatment trials and stepped wedge trials with the goal to engage in a discussion with the audience around what important features to pay attention to when designing such trials.

This symposium features three talks addressing mental health challenges among vulnerable adolescents in different global contexts. The first presentation discusses an academic-community partnership in North Carolina to improve depression treatment for Latino/a/e adolescents by developing culturally appropriate training modules for healthcare providers. The second talk evaluates a school-based resilience program in Nigeria, showing reductions in anxiety and depression among vulnerable adolescents. The third presentation explores the mental health care gap for adolescents living with HIV in Tanzania and the U.S., highlighting peer-led interventions and lessons from low-income settings that could be adapted for higher-income contexts.

## Understanding alcohol use and harm-reduction interventions in Northern Tanzania

([video](https://duke.zoom.us/rec/share/UiKx7OGY5E5jd7t3C3P5txAjcE9LuBbL6vYp69QiW9jrBfx9Tei7VD8C7qPb6g8v.Q74gtAkITEj25jPL))

This symposium presents four talks addressing alcohol use and its associated health impacts in Tanzania. The first study evaluates a brief negotiational intervention with mobile health boosters, showing significant reductions in harmful alcohol use among emergency department patients. The second talk outlines a plan to implement this intervention regionally, adapting it to local contexts. The third study explores the relationship between depression and alcohol use, finding no mediation effect of depression but suggesting the intervention may improve both conditions over time. The final presentation highlights the growing issue of prenatal alcohol use in Tanzania, emphasizing the need for community education and pre-pregnancy interventions to address fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

## Addressing mental health in the community: Implementation of research and practice from the Southern US to the Global South

([video](https://duke.zoom.us/rec/share/T2gA3o9-l6qlmUWQqQFx43Q5QkCtGyWmort4pXW_tv9UAR_txSFAPOv1CXj882nu.ARChIQQzGlszUONl))

A key objective of implementation science is increasing the accessibility and adoption of evidence-based practices and programs into health systems and communities. Mental health is increasingly recognized as both a negative health outcome and as a contributor to other negative health outcomes. Correspondingly, implementation studies may address mental health in different ways, ranging from screening to incorporating mental health into other programs to directly targeting mental health as a primary outcome. Importantly, a critical cross-cutting theme is engagement with the community at all stages of implementation. In this symposium, we will highlight different ways in which implementation science is addressing mental health in community-based settings, with focus on the role of community partnering and engagement at varying stages of implementation.

## Child and caregiver mental health: Global perspectives on risk and resilience

([Video](https://duke.zoom.us/rec/share/L8mcwDank8aNTEKfFiqjyJDYTYoPoBK3vRTsNNh0bvCvH97skktES9ubue2AExbk.fgkxWll6bDYYbjFG))

This symposium features four studies addressing the intersection of family engagement and mental health across diverse contexts. The first presentation evaluates the Family Connects postnatal nurse program, demonstrating long-term mental health benefits for parents. The second study examines the impact of prior maternal adversity on mental health during COVID-19 in rural Pakistan, finding that pre-pandemic adversity increased vulnerability but did not exacerbate mental health outcomes. The third talk highlights the importance of culturally adapting the "Coping Together" intervention for Latinx immigrant families to address acculturation gaps and strengthen family dynamics. The final study explores the challenges of inclusive education for students with autism in Brazil, emphasizing the critical role of consistent family involvement in supporting both student development and educator well-being.
